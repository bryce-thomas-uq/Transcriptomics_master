# Run FastQC from https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ to determine quality of seq
# Run from terminal
# Navigate to the file via filepath with cd
# List files in directory with ls
# Files should not be unzipped
# Exit out of files with cd ..
# Run using fastqc >your_filename_here.gz<
# If you use fastqc on *.gz it will do for all fastq files 
# If you have more than one core, you can specify the thread number with -t >thread number
# Threadnumber normally cores*2
# Output is an HTML file with the same name as file input
fastqc *.gz

# Transcriptome analysis requires reference genome
# Download fasta file, save in appropriate place, unzip
# Good places to look - Ensembl.org
# Need fasta cDNA files

# *Building an index*

# Run in terminal
# Use kallisto to build index
# -i instructs kallisto to build the index, next argument is the name of the index to be output - this should include all possible info, and name of fasta file to use
# Remove all text and chevrons to use code below
kallisto -i >name_ofindex_to_be_created< >name_of_fasta_file<
