# Transcriptome analysis requires reference genome
# Download fasta file, save in appropriate place, unzip
# Good places to look - Ensembl.org
# Need fasta cDNA files

# *Building an index*

# Run in terminal
# Use kallisto to build index
# -i instructs kallisto to build the index, next argument is the name of the index to be output - this should include all possible info, and name of fasta file to use
# Remove all text and chevrons to use code below, pay attention to filetype

Kallisto index -i name_of_index_to_be_created.index name_of_fasta_file.fa 

# After Index is created, must now map reads to the indexed reference host transcriptome
# Include the '&>' at the end of each line to outputa log file that is saved - useful for downstream analyses 
#if using single end reads certain extra parameters req:
#--single tells program it's single
#-l dictates median length
#-s dictates the standard deviation around this number. these values are not concrete, but are also not too precise - there is pleanty of room for error
#adding \ at the end of a line allows line breaks without interrupting code

#**FOR SINGLE END READS**
